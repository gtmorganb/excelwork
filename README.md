# Excel Homework 1 


The data provided in for the Kickstarter campaigns provided several conclusions about the tactics used in the projects. Of the 4114 total campaigns, 2185 of these were successful and 1530 failed. Of those remaining campaigns, 349 were cancelled and 50 are still live. The top two categories of successful campaigns were theater and music in respective order. The top two categories of failed campaigns were theater and technology in respective order. The most successful subcategory for campaigns was plays. And the most common subcategory for failed campaigns was equal among plays and wearables. The campaigns were spread among twelve months. May was the peak of successful campaigns and July was the peak of failed campaigns. 

One limitation of this data set is that there are duplicate values present. This means that some campaigns started, failed or were cancelled, then restarted. This data impacts the overall data by counting failures that eventually turned into successes. 

One helpful table would be to know which categories and subcategories were used each month. Since there was growth among successful campaigns between April and May, it would be helpful to know how categories changed in that timeframe to allow for the change. The same table would allow insight into the increase in failures between September and October. 

Based on the statistical bonus, the successful campaigns have a much high standard deviation than the unsuccessful campaigns. Both the mean and median for the successful campaigns is higher indicating that overall, successful campaigns have many more backers than unsuccessful campaigns.
